<u><h3>Experiment-1 : chap_2_exp_1.ipynb</h3></u>

In this experiment, I tried learning about creating our own data set, how to manpulate the data using different techniques like resizing, augumenting etc and then training a model on that data.

The best of the chapter comes in understanding how the process works from end-to-end creating a final webapp which is simple but has all the abilities to classify a image by having a chance to upload one ourselves. 

Also the final model trained will be exported & saved to export.pkl file which we will use for inference later stage any where. 

<u><h3>Experiment-1 : bears_web_app_chap_2_exp_1</h3></u>

This file consists of code where we will be using the exported model file for inference & prediction over the images we will be uploading. And all the widgets that are required to show up this notebook as a simple webapp.
